*DESCRIPTION*:I built a Real-Time Code Editor using React.js, Node.js, and WebSockets (Socket.IO) that allows multiple users to work together on the same code file in real time, much like Google Docs but designed specifically for programming. The frontend, developed with React and the CodeMirror library, delivers a modern, responsive interface with syntax highlighting, theme customization, and multi-language support for languages like JavaScript, Python, and C++. Users can create or join rooms via unique IDs, and any code changes are instantly reflected for all connected participants. On the backend, I used Node.js with Express.js to handle routing and WebSocket communication, leveraging Socket.IOâ€™s room-based event broadcasting to ensure seamless synchronization across all clients, even if someone joins mid-session. I implemented logic to send the latest code state to newly joined users, optimized state handling in React to minimize re-renders, and added error handling for disconnections and reconnections. This project gave me deep insights into real-time communication, bi-directional event handling, and the inner workings of collaborative web applications. I also experimented with enhancing the editor experience by allowing dynamic language mode switching, ensuring accurate syntax highlighting for different programming languages. Building and deploying this application taught me how to integrate frontend and backend technologies efficiently and manage data flow in live environments. In the future, I plan to extend it with authentication for user identity tracking, database integration for persistent file storage, and live preview functionality for HTML/CSS/JS projects, turning it into a fully featured online collaborative coding environment.
